# Telazer - Phaser Audio Helper

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repository-blue)](https://github.com/Telazer/phaser-audio-helper)

A TypeScript utility for [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io) that simplifies the loading, management, and playback of sound effects and music. With clear separation of keys and file paths, it offers an elegant API for managing game audio in a scalable way.

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install @telazer/phaser-audio-helper
```

---

## Key Features

- üîä Easy loading and playback of SFX and music
- üóùÔ∏è Distinct `key` and `source` mapping
- üéöÔ∏è Global volume control
- üîÅ Looping and sequence playback
- üé≤ Random playback utilities
- üéõÔ∏è Supports playback rate variation

---

## Getting Started

Import `AudioHelper` into your Phaser scene. It‚Äôs best to load sounds in a boot or preload scene.

---

## Example Scene Integration

```ts
import { AudioHelper } from "@telazer/phaser-audio-helper";

export class InitScene extends Phaser.Scene {
  preload() {
    AudioHelper.loadSfx(this, [
      { key: "pop", source: "./assets/sounds/pop.mp3", volume: 1 },
    ]);
  }

  async create() {
    AudioHelper.play("pop");
  }
}
```

---

## Loading Audio

### Load SFX

```ts
await AudioHelper.loadSfx(this, [
  { key: "click", source: "./assets/sounds/click.mp3", volume: 0.8 },
  { key: "jump", source: "./assets/sounds/jump.wav", volume: 1.0 },
]);
```

### Load Music

```ts
await AudioHelper.loadMusic(this, [
  { key: "bg_music", source: "./assets/music/loop.mp3", volume: 1 },
]);
```

---

## Playback

### Play a Sound

```ts
AudioHelper.play("click");
```

### Play Music

```ts
AudioHelper.play("bg_music"); // Plays in loop mode
```

### Stop Sound or Music

```ts
AudioHelper.stop("click");
```

---

## Advanced Playback

### Set Global Volume

```ts
AudioHelper.setSoundVolume(0.5);
AudioHelper.setMusicVolume(0.8);
```

### Play with Randomized Rate

```ts
AudioHelper.playRate("jump", 0.1); // ¬±10% pitch variance
```

### Play a Random Sound

```ts
AudioHelper.playRandom(["hit_1", "hit_2", "hit_3"]);
```

### Play in Sequence

```ts
AudioHelper.playSequence(["step_1", "step_2", "step_3"], 150, 30); // ¬±30ms variance
```

## `AudioItem` Structure

```ts
interface AudioItem {
  key: string; // Internal reference key
  source: string; // Path to the audio file
  volume: number; // Individual volume multiplier (0‚Äì1)
}
```
